ACI CNI Plugin
==============

The Cisco Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) CNI plugin brings the ACI Networking and Policy model to Kubernetes clusters that reside on-prem or in the cloud. It is fully open source and relies on the `Opflex Protocol <https://github.com/opendaylight/opflex>`_ to program Open vSwitch instances running on the Kubernetes nodes. It provides IP address management, L2/L3 networking, load balancing, and security functions for container workloads.
